## StoryBook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as stories to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

This project also supports storybooks which can give you a wrap around for the various components and pages used in the app.
You can also use those pages as they have been configured by using add ons to work , As these pages are dependent on each other 
The right format to use these pages are: SigUp -> Login -> Avatar -> Chat
